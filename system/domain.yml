        "A language flourishes when it is heard and spoken. Therefore, all language courses require at least 75% lecture attendance to be permitted to the examination. Please read the general exam regulations section 4 art. 3.
        75% attendance is:
        \n* 3 absent times for courses with 2 weekly semester hours
        \n* 6 absent times for courses with 4 weekly semester hours
        \n* 9 absent times* for courses with 6 weekly semester hours

        \n(One absent time = 2 teaching units = 2 x 45 minutes)

        \nIf this limit of absence is exceeded, the Centre for Studies will send an email to notify you of your examination exclusion.

        \nIt is not necessary to excuse absences. However, do make sure to keep medical certificates and other documentation justifying your absences until the end of the semester.

        An elective, or AWP subject (Allgemeinwissenschaftliches Wahlpflichtfach), or a compulsory language course are subjects specified in your study and examination regulations. Voluntary subjects are taken purely on a voluntary basis without accreditation of any ECTS credits.

  utter_choose_language_as_awp:
    - text: "Yes, it is possible to choose a language course as an AWP subject. It may even be a requirement in some degree programs."

  utter_recognize_intensive_language_course:
    - text: |
        Of course! Our fee-based intensive language courses are offered at the end of each semester break. You will have to decide which type of credit you would like to receive when selecting the course: either as AWP subject, compulsory language course, or voluntary subject (without ECTS).

  utter_select_multiple_awp_or_language_courses:
    - text: |
        If an AWP subject or a compulsory language course is scheduled for a particular semester, the faculty blocks the AWP and language time slots in the corresponding semester. If you prepone or postpone courses, or voluntarily take additional courses, you are welcome to register for additional courses after matching the lecture schedules of AWP subjects and language courses with your schedule of faculty lectures, as long as courses are still available.

  utter_prepone_or_postpone_course:
    - text: |
        If your lecture schedule allows it, you can also prepone or postpone subjects. Please pay special attention to course times to avoid overlapping lectures.

  utter_recognize_voluntary_subject:
    - text: "No, a later recognition is unfortunately not possible. You need to decide which type of credit you would like to receive for the subject the moment you register for the examination at the latest."

  utter_pick_best_grade_subject:
    - text: "No, this is unfortunately not possible. The grade of the subject you first chose as AWP subject/compulsory language course counts and cannot be changed later on."

  utter_withdraw_from_course:
    - text: |
        You may only deregister from an AWP subject or a compulsory language course if you have not yet written an examination in the subject or have not yet received a grade for it, and if it is still possible to deregister (7 days before the examination date at the latest).

  utter_switch_course_group:
    - text: "No, unfortunately, this is not possible and is only permitted in absolutely exceptional cases. Please contact us by e-mail (sprachenzentrum@th-deg.de) to clarify whether your case falls into this category."

  utter_repeat_exam_in_case_of_failure:
    - text: |
        In case of failure, you will have to retake the examination in the second attempt in the following semester or in a third attempt within one year. Register for the repeat examination during the examination registration period.

  utter_attend_language_course_again:
    - text: |
        If you have already fulfilled the attendance requirement for a language course, it's up to you whether you repeat the course or not. Consider discussing examination content with the lecturer for preparation.

  utter_fail_examination:
    - text: |
        If you fail an examination, you can retake the exam in the second attempt within one year. Register for the repeat examination during the registration period. Repeat exams may occur earlier in the semester.

        If the course isn't offered in your second or third attempt, a specific date will be set. While attendance is fulfilled for language courses, it's your choice to retake. Discussing content with the lecturer can be helpful. Note the lecturer conducting the course holds the examination.

  utter_register_procedure:
    - text: Check your email. It should be an email from julia.vollbrecht@th-deg.de. Inside this email you will be able to find instructions of registration. Good luck!
