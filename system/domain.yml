  utter_compulsory_attedance:
    - text: "A language flourishes when it is heard and spoken. Therefore, all language courses require at least 75% lecture attendance to be permitted to the examination. Please read the general exam regulations section 4 art. 3.
              75% attendance is:
              \n* 3 absent times for courses with 2 weekly semester hours
              \n* 6 absent times for courses with 4 weekly semester hours
              \n* 9 absent times* for courses with 6 weekly semester hours

              \n(One absent time = 2 teaching units = 2 x 45 minutes)
              
              \nIf this limit of absence is exceeded, the Centre for Studies will send an email to notify you of your examination exclusion.

              \nIt is not necessary to excuse absences. However, do make sure to keep medical certificates and other documentation justifying your absences until the end of the semester.
